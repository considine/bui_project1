To run the interpreter (with built in input I have in the main driver at bottom) run python SchemeInterpreter/stack_machine.py from main project folder


To run unit tests, run:  python -m tests.arithmeticExpr from main project folder

Adding shell version tomorrow, and List operations (right now strictly arithmetic operations, but fairly good code base so adding list ops shouldn't be too hard)

I added scm files from pro paradigms sophomore year that I hope to be able to successfully run
